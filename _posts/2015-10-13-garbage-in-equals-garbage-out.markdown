On Sunday's I typically do a long run of 100 to 150 minutes depending on what I'm training for. Afterwards, I'm out and about. Sunday's are for visiting friends, doing errands, and spending time with family. After a long run, I'm tired, but not spent. I don't crash within hours.

Some of my running friends are shocked. They spent the rest of thier Sunday's after a long run with their feet on the couch. So what do I do? Two things, I stay away from processed sugar and I eat a lot of protein and fat. I'm not a sports nutritionist, but this is what I've found works. Certainly, our bodies are craving sugar. After 12 miles you can feel your blood sugar start to drop.

However, we need to repair our bodies after a long run. Fat and protein do this. Simple sugars like donuts may taste good, but like eating sugar at any other time of day you get a sugar high then crash.

My favorite post long run meal is a roll with ricotta cheese, a piece of fruit ( apple, banana, or peach, etc.), and three eggs. I wash it all down with a liter of water and a few cups of tea.

So how do I feel. Sure I fee tired, I feel my muscles, but I don't crash. Within an hour or so of coming home, I'm usually out doing something or going somewhere. If you're getting the runners blues and spend the afternoon sleeping, you're not eating right. The next day I also feel great. Eating well promotes a strong recovery. I'm able to run with out feeling fatigued and my muscles feel strong.

In closing, remember that garbage in equals garbage out. If you want to run strong, run fresh, and run ready you need to eat well after your runs.
