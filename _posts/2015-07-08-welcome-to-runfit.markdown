Welcome to RunFit. RunFit is a project by Ely Greenberg and Erg Process Energy to develop mobile apps for runners. Yes, EPE's core business is developing web and mobile apps to solve water and environmental challenges. However, running is a passion as well. 

I've been running non-stop for over a decade. I love it. Running is medatative and relaxing. Some might think that strange, but it's true. Over the years I've developed lots of strategies to train for races and remain injury free. Through RunFit I'd like to share those with you. 

See you on the road,
