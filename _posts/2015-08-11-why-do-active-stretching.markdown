Stretching after your run helps your body cool down and recover. Running stresses large muscle groups including your pelvic muscles, glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps and calves. Proper stretching is important for increasing flexibility, reducing inflammation, and speeding recovery. 

In addition to regular stretching, you should also do active stretching - skipping, high knees, jogging backwards, and karaoke. These movements stretch the smaller muscles in your legs. Running works the larger muscles in your legs, and while these muscle groups gets stronger, the smaller stabilizer muscles that support them get weak. This imbalance in strength can lead to injury. Active stretching helps to ensure that these smaller muscles are sufficiently strong to help you on your run. 

Active stretching is included in the Run Fresh app. Download it, and make these active stretches part of your post run routine.
