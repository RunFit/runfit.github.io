For many of us the only time of day that we can fit in a run is early in the morning. However, waking up at 5:30 or 6:00 can be a real bear. Who wants to get out of bed when it's cold and dark? Likewise, in the morning we often feel stiff, and depending on your sleeping conditions you may feel like you have cotton mouth from dry air. In turn your body is dehydrated. 

How can you make your morning runs easier? Drink a glass of water before bed. Based on experience drinking a glass of water about 90 minutes before going to sleep will keep you hydrated throughout the night. You'll wake up better hydrated and you'll feel like you have more energy. As a result your early morning run will feel so much better. ( This of course assumes that you were well hydrated during the day. If you get dehyrated during the day one glass of water before bed won't make you feel better. )

We all have different hydration requirements and you'll have to figure out what works for you. Could you wake up in he middle of the night? It's possible. But eventually your body will adjust. Drinking 90 before gives your body time to process what you drank. So ideally your glass of water will be processed and you'll go to the bathroom before you fall asleep.

When you wake up have another glass of water or juice and then hit the road. Just go. Don't think about it - just go.
