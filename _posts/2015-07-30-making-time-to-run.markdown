Finding the time to run and exercise when you have kids is tough. When you're single or childless it's much easier to set your schedule. Recently, I became a father and finding time to run is a challenge. I always put my family first, but I still like to get on the road for a few miles. 

Should I run first thing in the morning, fit in a run when my child is sleeping, or run later in the day? On top of that as a new parent sleep is in short supply. I'm always tired. What to do?

I've settled on two approaches. The first is running first thing in the morning. Usually, everyone else is still asleep, and it's the time of day when I have the most energy. Whether I got 3 hours or 7 hours of sleep, usually the former, I still have enough energy to run. I'd rather be tired later on in the day and power through. However, slowly I'm adjusting and often I can grab a 20 minute nap.

Additionally, I've been extending this approach of running first thing in the morning and experimenting with run commuting. I can get to the office in about 75 minutes. Basically, that's a medium long run. Doing that two or three days a week is sure to have great benefits.

The second approach is to use Run Strong for the days that I cannot get outside to run. There is just too much going on. Run Strong is six minutes of high intensity body weight exercises. I break a sweat, my hear rate goes up, and it feels like going on a short run.

In conclusion, family is always first, but I still love to run. It's very meditative. I'm still trying to figure out how to balance it all, and while my running may be fewer days per week, it is higher intensity.
