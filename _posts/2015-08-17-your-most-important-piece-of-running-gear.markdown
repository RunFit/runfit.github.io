Your most important piece of running gear is your running hat. It's not your shoes or your shorts - it's your hat. Your hat keeps you cool when it's hot and warm when it's cold.

This summer it's been 90 plus degrees with nasty humidity, and I've been staying cool on my runs thanks to my hat. For comparison, last Sunday I did 12 miles without a hat and I was parched. When it was over I felt hotter, more dehydrated, and generally more exhausted. 

Yesterday, I did 15 miles with my hat. The weather conditions were similar to last Sunday, but I felt better afterwards. My head was noticably cooler, my face wasn't hot, and the hat soaked up a great deal of sweat which keeps my face feeling better. 

Running hats don't have to be fancy. Mine is a simple running hat made of a moisture wicking material. It honestly isn't even a name brand. In general any running hat will do. Moisture wicking is best, but the main goal is to cover your head when you run.

By Keeping your head covered when your running in extreme heat you'll stay cool and run further.
