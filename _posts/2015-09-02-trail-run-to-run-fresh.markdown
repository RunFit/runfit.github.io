Last week, I went on vacation to the Adirondacks. Second to running, I am passionate about hiking. While I did lots of great hiking in the mountains I also took the opportunity to go out for some early morning trail runs. My runs varied in length, from about two to eight miles. One of my runs was only two miles up hill to a scenic lookout.

Running on trails is refreshing for many reasons - the air is typically cleaner, the views are more inspiring, and it's easier on the muscles than concrete sidewalks. In addition to being a softer surface, trails ensure that each step is not the same. Running on concrete can lead to repetitive injuries since your foot always lands the same after each stride. When you run on trails your foot may land differently each time. This variation helps to improve balance and strengthen the smaller muscles in your foot and ankle.

In conclusion trail running helps you run fresh. In addition to doing exercises to strengthen your muscles trail running is a great relief for your muscles, improves balance, and strengthens your feet and ankles. If you're a city dweller get out of the city when you can or find those precious little green spaces to run on so that you can run fresh and run fit and ultimately run strong.
